Code .py file-

1. Perform missing value and outlier treatment, if needed, in the data set you received.
2. Perform categorical variable treatment:
  a. Identify the categorical columns 
  b.Use suitable techniques to treat these categorical columns. For instance, as explained earlier, the banner position is a categorical variable. 
3. Perform a train-test split in the data set (the usual split followed in the industry is 70-30 or 80-20).
4. Identify the 3 classification methods you will use in the data set, and explain the reason you chose those 3 methods in the notebook file you will share in the submission process.
5. For all 3 methods, use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance. Also, evaluate the models' basis the cross-validation.
6. Compare which methods work best based on the evaluation metrics mentioned in the previous point.
7. Use model simplification techniques like feature creation and selection, to improve model predictability.
